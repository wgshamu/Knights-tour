# Knights-tour
Using recursive code to solve the knight's tour.

The knight's tour is a simple puzzle that involves having a knight, starting at any of the corner squares,
traverse the entirety of the chessboard without ever revisiting a single square.
This program works by using recursive code in order to have the knight continuously visit the square with the least amount of possible moves
after that, and if at any point it reaches a dead end, it will reverse and try again.
